I (stubbornly) started searching for a typeface after [Jules](https://twitter.com/julesforrest) convinced me that [the system font stack](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/system-font-stack/) on [danoc.me](https://danoc.me/) just wasn't cutting it. This search led me down a month-long journey into the world of type.

The journey ended last week with the purchase of [Untitled Sans](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/untitled-sans/), a typeface from a New Zeland based font foundry called [Klim](https://klim.co.nz/about/).

I'd like to share the process I took to find a typeface.

## Learning about type

I wanted to learn the basics of typography before choosing a typeface.

## Finding sites that I liked

## Testing out the fonts
